# Leaflet.TileLayer.BlackAndWhite

A regular TileLayer with black and white makeover.

Based on the [grayscale TileLayer](https://github.com/Zverik/leaflet-grayscale) by [Ilya Zverev](http://ilya.zverev.info/)

## Usage

Just use `L.tileLayer.blackAndWhite(url, options)` instead of `L.tileLayer(url, options)`.

Ilya recommends using `fadeAnimation: false` option when creating the map object. Otherwise you will see a lot of flickering.
